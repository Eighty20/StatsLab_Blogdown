Of course the weather is a known chaotic system, therefore we will try to create an initial benchmark by throwing a deep learning model at the problem.

        This blog will take a look at scraping the TomTom and Google Places APIs to get all the points of interest in an area. A recursive grid search algorithm is discussed that efficiently identifies all of the POIs in a large area where there is a limit on the number of results the API returns. 
TomTom vs Google First, let&rsquo;s compare each API:
    TomTom Google Places     Max free daily requests 2500 2500   Max results returned 100 20   Point search Yes Yes   Max point search radius none 50km   Rectangle search Yes No   Up-to-date No Yes    In each case, you need to register for your own API key which you include as a parameter in the search.

        This is a follow on post to Stefan&rsquo;s original to show how to generate a blog post from a Jupyter Notebook instead of an R markdown. This post itself started off life as a Jupyter Notebook which lives in the same content/posts folder as the other Rmd files used for the site. We&rsquo;ll walk through how it became a blog post.
The process is a little more complicated than for the Rmd files (since that&rsquo;s what Blogdown was built for but we can still get it to work relatively easily.

        Dealing with nested data can be really frustrating…
Especially if you want to keep your workspace nice and tidy with all your data in tables!
With no actual experience trying to get at these nested tibbles can seem almost impossible:
via GIPHY
--  Downloading data from an api created by Blizzard To illustrate how you would deal with nested data I found an api that let’s you download all kinds of data on the e-sport/game called Overwatch.

        <span class="post-date">Tue, Mar 27, 2018</span>
        Why data-wrangling If you can wrangle data into the proper form you can do anything with it…
 Data-wrangling is absolutely essential for every data science task where we need to work with collected data.
 A recent article from the New York Times said “Data scientists, according to interviews and expert estimates, spend from 50 percent to 80 percent of their time mired in the mundane labor of collecting and preparing data, before it can be explored for useful information.

        Why it matters When working with recurring clients and projects together with tight deadlines it is easy to cut corners or forget good practice.
Here are the top reasons why a data science workflow is vital:
 Work is well documented
 Folders and files logically are structured
 Projects remain version controlled
 Data output is tracked
 Logical seperation of scripts make productizing easy
 Good naming conventions make tracking of the project flow easy

        <span class="post-date">Wed, Nov 15, 2017</span>
        Overview Having just started playing with deeplearning models in R, I wanted to visually compare them to other more traditional ML workflows. Of course, deeplearning is generally used where other models fail, but with no need for feature selection and rapidly increasing power and ease of use they may just evolve into a general learning paradigm.
 However, with tabular data and packages like caret the machine learning methods have become so streamlined that minimal user input is required at all.

Based on the work:
Lawson, John. Design and Analysis of Experiments with R. Chapman and Hall/CRC, 20141217. VitalBook file.
  Definitions  Experiment (also called a Run) is an action where the experimenter changes at least one of the variables being studied and then observes the effect of his or her actions(s).
