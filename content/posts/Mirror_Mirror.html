<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Saving your R dataframe to a <code>.csv</code> can be useful; being able to view the data all at once can help to see the bigger picture. Often though, multiple dataframes, all pieces of the same project, need to be viewed this way and related back to one another. In this case viewing becomes far easier when these dataframes are written to <code>.xlsx</code> across multiple sheets in a single workbook. Not to mention the time and energy saved when you no longer have to find and open multiple files.</p>
<p>Four packages in R are available to do just this. I generated some test data (a 30000 x 40 dataframe with sampled values between 1 and 100) and tested each one with varying levels of success.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Set seed
set.seed(127)

# Create 1200000 sample values between 1 and 100 with replacement
sample.values &lt;- sample(1:100, 1200000, replace = TRUE) 

# Create 30000 x 40 matrix using sample values
sample.matrix &lt;- as.data.frame(matrix(sample.values, nrow = 30000, ncol = 40))

# Character list to be used to name sheets in worksheet
num &lt;- as.character(1:10)</code></pre>

<h1>Package use</h1>
<div id="the-xlsx-package" class="section level2">
<h2>The xlsx package</h2>
<p>I ran into problems very early on with this package. The installation was dependent on the <code>rJava</code> package which gave an error during installation. Given that we’re using a Unix platform, the fix to this was to run <code>sudo apt-get install r-cran-rjava</code> in console. Executing this command succesfully installed the package and after restarting R-studio I was able to install and load the <code>xlsx</code> package.</p>
<p>The next problem I ran into was a java out of memory error, specifically <code>java.lang.OutOfMemoryError</code>. This time the fix was allocating more memory to Java trough the <code>options(java.parameters = &quot;-Xmx40000m&quot;)</code> setting. The memory increase amount (and therefore the amount of data that can be written) is dependent on the amount of memory your computer can allocate to R. In this case I have allocated 40gig, which most of us do not have laying around. Once this was done I was able write up to 10 worksheets without any problems, but again, I ran into memory problems when I tried to scale up.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#---- Create function performing xlsx tasks ----#

Checkxlsx &lt;- function ( num, sample.matrix ) {

  wb &lt;- xlsx::createWorkbook(type = &quot;xlsx&quot;)

  for ( i in 1:length(num) ) {
  
    sheet.i = paste0(&quot;sheet&quot;, i)
    sheet &lt;- xlsx::createSheet(wb, sheet.i)
    xlsx::addDataFrame(x = sample.matrix, sheet = sheet, col.names = FALSE, row.names = FALSE) 
  }

  xlsx::saveWorkbook(wb, &quot;xlsx_test.xlsx&quot;)
}</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="the-xlconnect-package" class="section level2">
<h2>The XLConnect package</h2>
<p>This package had all the same problems as the previous with one added extra. During testing, the writing process was done many times; each time it was done the previous <code>.xlsx</code> file saved as the same name needed to be deleted. If this wasn’t done R would continue attempting to write to the file indefinitely with no indications of stopping. There seems to be a fix for this using the <code>createNames()</code> function but it didn’t seem worth the effort.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#---- Create function performing XLConnect tasks ----# 

CheckXLConnect &lt;- function ( num, sample.matrix ) {

  wb &lt;- XLConnect::loadWorkbook(&quot;XLConnect_test.xlsx&quot;)
  sapply(num, function(x) XLConnect::createSheet(wb, x))

  for ( i in 1:length(num) ) {
    XLConnect::writeWorksheet(wb, sample.matrix, as.character(i), header = FALSE)
  }
  
  XLConnect::saveWorkbook(wb)
}</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="the-writexls-package" class="section level2">
<h2>The WriteXLS package</h2>
<p>This package was easy enough to use with no apparent errors. The problem was that because this method writes the data directly into a workbook, instead of first creating it locally within the R environment, it was extremely slow.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Name list of dataframes to be used to name sheets
names(sample.matrix.list) &lt;- num

# Create list of dataframes
sample.matrix.list &lt;- lapply(seq_len(as.numeric(num)), function(X) sample.matrix)

# Write list of dataframes to xlsx
WriteXLS(sample.matrix.list, &quot;sample_matrix2.xlsx&quot;, col.names = FALSE)</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="the-openxlsx-package" class="section level2">
<h2>The openxlsx package</h2>
<p>Finally, I looked to the <code>opnexlsx</code> package. Again, no problems here; the most user friendly of the four.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#---- Create function performing openxlsx tasks ----#

CheckOpenxlsx &lt;- function ( num, sample.matrix ) {
    
  wb &lt;- openxlsx::createWorkbook()
  sapply(num, function(x) openxlsx::addWorksheet(wb, x))

  for ( i in 1:length(num) ) {
    openxlsx::writeData(wb, i, sample.matrix, colNames = FALSE)
  }

  openxlsx::saveWorkbook(wb, file = &quot;openxlsx_test.xlsx&quot;, overwrite = TRUE)
}</code></pre>

<div id="microbenchmark-test-findings" class="section level1">
<h1>Microbenchmark test findings</h1>
<p>After using each of the four packages I decided, taking usability, memory issues and speed into account, not to continue further with the <code>WriteXLS</code> and the <code>XLConnect</code> packages. I then tested the speed of the remaining two, <code>openxlsx</code> and <code>xlsx</code>, using the <code>microbenchmark</code> package with an evaluation number of 5 and varying sheet numbers.</p>

<p>Graphing the mean, median, min and max times for both the <code>openxlsx</code> and the <code>xlsx</code>packages show that other than min time, the <code>openxlsx</code> package is faster.</p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>After testing each of the four packages using a dataframe of 30000 x 40 random numbers bewteen 1 and 100, I found that 2 of the packages, the <code>XLConnect</code>package and the <code>WriteXLS</code> package, were either not very user friendly or were simply too slow. The remaining two, the <code>openxlsx</code> package and the <code>xlsx</code> package, were then tested using the <code>microbenchmark</code> package with an evaluation number of 5 and various sheet numbers. The tests concluded that the <code>openxlsx</code> package was overall faster. With this in mind and with the ease of use for this package, it comes in as the favorite.</p>
