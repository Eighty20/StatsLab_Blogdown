<h2>What is GNU SCREEN</h2>
<p>GNU SCREEN (screen) is a text-based program usually described as a window manager or terminal multiplexer. While it does a great many things, its two biggest features are its detachability and its multiplexing. The detachability means that you can run programs from within screen, detach and logout, then log in later, reattach, and the programs will still be there. The multiplexing means that you can have multiple programs running within a single screen session, each within its own window. You can display multiple windows at once, or just switch between them, even if you only have a single terminal window to use.</p>

<div id="benefits-of-using-screen" class="section level2">
<h2>Benefits of using screen</h2>
<p>If your local computer crashes or you lose the connection, the processes or login sessions you establish through screen don’t go away. The screen program creates multiple processes instead of multiple Unix login sessions, which means that it is resource-efficient. Using the detach feature, you can save screen processes when logging out and resume where you left off, saving the trouble of restarting them.</p>

<div id="why-not-just-use-or-crontab" class="section level2">
<h2>Why not just use ‘&amp;’ or CronTab?</h2>
<p>Running a MySQL query with ‘&amp;’ alone does not guarantee your query will not be interupted. You will have to use <code>nohup (ignore the hangup signal)</code>. From out experience this did not always work. Screen provides an elegant and user friendly way to run multiple queries without having to fear it being interupted or not being able to return to it at any time.</p>
<p>CronTab does not let us specify a year. This means if you forget to remove an entry it will run the next year again, automatically, even if you are not with us anymore! It also does not allow us to kick it off manually.</p>
</div>
<div id="when-should-i-use-screen" class="section level2">
<h2>When should I use screen</h2>
<p>When executing a SQL query or script that will take a long time to complete. You can use screen anytime you like and you might find various personal use cases.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>NOTE: Do not use background processes (&amp;). When you detach from your screen it will run in the background and you can start a new screen.</p>

<div id="how-to-use-screen" class="section level2">
<h2>How to use screen</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>SSH into your server as you normally would.</li>
<li><p>Type <code>screen -dR &quot;your username&quot;</code> to create a named screen for you to work in. If you type <code>screen -ls</code> you will now see you have a socket like this:</p>
<pre class="console"><code>PL-MS-i5-2019# screen -ls
There is a screen on:
    45.pieter     (02/08/19 14:01:16)     (Attached)
1 Socket in /run/screen/S-root.</code></pre>
Here I can see I have a Socket named <code>45.pieter</code> and I am currently connected to it since it is Attached.</li>
<li><p>Now you can run your commands as you normally would. For Example:</p>
<pre class="sql"><code>mysql my_test_script.sql &gt; output.log 2&gt; err.log</code></pre></li>
<li><p>To detach from a session and let it run in the background press <code>Ctrl+a</code> this tells screen you will be inputting a command and then press <code>d</code> to detach from this session. You should see a message like: <code>[detached from 45.pieter]</code> You are now free to close your terminal. You will see this socket is now detached when you run <code>screen -ls</code>.</p>
<pre class="console"><code>PL-MS-i5-2019# screen -ls
There is a screen on:
    137.pieter      (02/08/19 15:24:35)     (Detached)
1 Socket in /run/screen/S-root.</code></pre></li>
<li><p>To get your screen back you need to reattach to it with <code>screen -dR</code> or <code>screen -dR pieter</code> if you need to connect to a specific one.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>You can close and terminate any screen you are attached to and working in at any time by pressing <code>Ctrl+a</code> and then typing <code>:quit</code>. A short way is simply typing <code>exit</code> but you do carry the risk of exiting Putty completely.</p>
If you close your ssh connection without detaching, or lose your network connection: 1. run `screen -dR
<screen name>
<p>The -dR means “find my screen session, detach it from wherever it’s attached if it’s attached, and reattach it here, if I don’t already have a session, create one”</p>
</div>
<div id="dos-and-donts" class="section level2">
<h2>DOs and DON’Ts</h2>
<ul>
<li>Do create a screen, with a descriptive name, for each big query you are running.</li>
<li>Do close your screen sessions when you are done using them.</li>
<li>Don’t use nohup and/or ‘&amp;’ in screen. It is not necessary.</li>
<li>Dont</li>
</ul>
