      <description>OverviewHaving just started playing with deeplearning models in R, I wanted to visually compare them to other more traditional ML workflows. Of course, deeplearning is generally used where other models fail, but with no need for feature selection and rapidly increasing power and ease of use they may just evolve into a general learning paradigm.
However, with tabular data and packages like caret the machine learning methods have become so streamlined that minimal user input is required at all.</description>
