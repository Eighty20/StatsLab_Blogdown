      <description>This is a follow on post to Stefan&amp;rsquo;s original to show how to generate a blog post from a Jupyter Notebook instead of an R markdown. This post itself started off life as a Jupyter Notebook which lives in the same content/posts folder as the other Rmd files used for the site. We&amp;rsquo;ll walk through how it became a blog post.
The process is a little more complicated than for the Rmd files (since that&amp;rsquo;s what Blogdown was built for but we can still get it to work relatively easily.</description>
