      <description>This is a follow on post to Stefan&amp;rsquo;s original to show how to generate a blog post from a Jupyter Notebook instead of an R markdown.

The process is a little more complicated than for the Rmd files (since that&amp;rsquo;s what Blogdown was built for but we can still get it to work relatively easily.</description>
