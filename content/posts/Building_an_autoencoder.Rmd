## What are autoencoders?

The main purpose of an encoder is to map high dimensional data into lower dimensional data by minimizing the loss of decoding accuracy.  

_How is that different from dimensionality reduction?_  

Well.. it is and it isn't... In it's simplest case the neural network can use basicly linear activation functions to approximate a PCA. The important thing is that it is an approximation.  
Autoencoders are not unsupervised learning algorithms, instead they are self-learning algorithms since the network will try to replicate itself from lower dimensional space. In this sense the net will not really extract those features that are usefull to understand the data as much as it will extract the most important features to reproduce the data.

We can however perform dimensionality reduction if we redefine the loss function however:  
<https://github.com/kylemcdonald/Parametric-t-SNE/blob/master/Parametric%20t-SNE%20(Keras).ipynb>  

In that great python notebook the author *kylemcdonald* defines a t-sne loss function in python and uses it to perform autoencoding via t-sne.

## How do we build them?

We can build one quite simply by defining the encoding layers and the decoding layers;  

![](/Pictures/Autoencoders/what_are_autoencoders.png)

Initially people did this by defining a simple symmetrical neural network like this:  

![](/Pictures/Autoencoders/autoencoder_net.png)  

The initial half was responsible for encoding into lower dimensional space and the decoder was responible for mapping it back again to validate information loss.  
In practice the network does not need to be symmetrical at all and can be more complicated such as having CNN layers for image encoding.  

## Build it

OK, so let's show how the autoencoder is built by defining the encoder and decoder

### Step 1 - load and prepare the data

For the initial example we will use the iris dataset as our hello world showcase  

#### Split test train

```{r}
split_ind <- iris$Species %>% caret::createDataPartition(p = 0.8,list = FALSE)

train <- iris[split_ind,]
test <- iris[-split_ind,]

```

#### Pre-process

Note, normally you would need to perform one-hot encoding for the classes but since we are not going to train the model to classify this isn't really needed...  

```{r}
train_X <- train[,1:4] %>% as.matrix()

train_y <- train[,5] %>% 
  keras::to_categorical()

test_X <- test[,1:4] %>% as.matrix()

```

### Step 2 - define the encoder and decoder

It's the encoder's job to embed the data into lower dimensional space. So logically it should map from the initial input dimensions to the specified number of perceptrons in the output layer as new dimensions:  

Notice that we define the different parts seperately because we are going to use the keras functional api instead in order to keep the individual models `encoder` and `decoder`

```{r}
input_layer <- 
  layer_input(shape = c(4)) 

encoder <- 
  input_layer %>% 
  layer_dense(units = 150, activation = "relu") %>% 
  layer_batch_normalization() %>% 
  layer_dropout(rate = 0.2) %>% 
  layer_dense(units = 50, activation = "relu") %>%
  layer_dropout(rate = 0.1) %>%
  layer_dense(units = 25, activation = "relu") %>%
  layer_dense(units = 2) # 2 dimensions for the output layer

decoder <- 
  encoder %>% 
  layer_dense(units = 150, activation = "relu") %>% 
  layer_dropout(rate = 0.2) %>% 
  layer_dense(units = 50, activation = "relu") %>%
  layer_dropout(rate = 0.1) %>%
  layer_dense(units = 25, activation = "relu") %>%
  layer_dense(units = 4) # 4 dimensions for the original 4 variables


```

After the initial run of this post I added a normalization layer at the start and I moved from the popular RMSPROP optimzation algo to the ADAM algo. This improved the reconstruction part `decoder` to almost insane levels while leaving the encoder more or less the same.

### Step 3 - compile and train the autoencoder

To train the encoder we need to capture the initial input as our goal and back-propogate to best represent it  
We treat this as a basic regression so we will use some arbitrary regression loss function (nothing fancy like t-sne)  

```{r}
autoencoder_model <- keras_model(inputs = input_layer, outputs = decoder)

autoencoder_model %>% compile(
  loss='mean_squared_error',
  optimizer='adam',
  metrics = c('accuracy')
)

summary(autoencoder_model)
```

Now we train onto itself:  

```{r}
history <-
  autoencoder_model %>%
  keras::fit(train_X,
             train_X,
             epochs=100,
             shuffle=TRUE,
             validation_data= list(test_X, test_X)
             )
```

The training seems to have gone pretty well:  

```{r}
plot(history)
```

So now that we believe we have trained our encoder to embed the data into lower dimensional space, let's actually look at this data...  

#### Visualize the embedding

First we can use the complete model to visualize the reproduced points vs the actual points

```{r}
reconstructed_points <- 
  autoencoder_model %>% 
  keras::predict_on_batch(x = train_X)

Viz_data <- 
  dplyr::bind_rows(
  reconstructed_points %>% 
    tibble::as_tibble() %>% 
    setNames(names(train_X %>% tibble::as_tibble())) %>% 
    dplyr::mutate(data_origin = "reconstructed"),
  train_X %>% 
    tibble::as_tibble() %>% 
    dplyr::mutate(data_origin = "original")
  )

Viz_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(Petal.Length,Sepal.Width, color = data_origin))+
  geom_point()

```

~~OK.. so this isn't quite as sexy as I wanted~~ Nevermind, after playing with some dropout and normalization layers together with the optimizer the result is just redic. This dataset isn't even very large, but at least the iris dataset is nice and clean. 

~~The lossy reconstruction is effectively just linear components.~~ Now it is non-linear... 

### Step 4 - Extract the weights of the encoder

Once we have decided on the autoencoder to use we can have a closer look at the encoder part only. There are various ways to do this but what I will do is extract the weights from the autoencoder and use them to define the encoder.

```{r}
autoencoder_weights <- 
  autoencoder_model %>%
  keras::get_weights()

# autoencoder_weights
```

We can see that our encoder stops at the 6th layer... Since it produces the 2 dimensional output there.

We can also inspect the types of these variables:

```{r}
autoencoder_weights %>% purrr::map_chr(class)
```

#### Save the weights

```{r}
  keras::save_model_weights_hdf5(object = autoencoder_model,filepath = '../../static/data/autoencoder_weights.hdf5',overwrite = TRUE)
```

### Step 5 - Load up the weights into an ecoder model and predict

We can now specify a brand new model, BUT we can use the layers we have already defined to specify only the input layer and the encoder...  

Now we only load up the weights by specifying the by_name argument so that the layer `encoder` inherits the weights without bothering with the decoder layer.

```{r}
encoder_model <- keras_model(inputs = input_layer, outputs = encoder)

encoder_model %>% keras::load_model_weights_hdf5(filepath = "../../static/data/autoencoder_weights.hdf5",skip_mismatch = TRUE,by_name = TRUE)

encoder_model %>% compile(
  loss='mean_squared_error',
  optimizer='adam',
  metrics = c('accuracy')
)

```

#### Compare to pca

OK great! Now we can use the predict function with the new encoder model to see just how this encoder has embeded the higher dimensional data in 2 dimensions:

```{r}
embeded_points <- 
  encoder_model %>% 
  keras::predict_on_batch(x = train_X)

embeded_points %>% head
```

To compare this we also create a pca using the caret package:

```{r}
pre_process <- caret::preProcess(train_X,method = "pca",pcaComp = 2)


pca <- predict(pre_process,train_X)

pca %>% head
```

```{r}
Viz_data_encoded <- 
  dplyr::bind_rows(
  pca %>% 
    tibble::as_tibble() %>% 
    setNames(c("dim_1","dim_2")) %>% 
    dplyr::mutate(data_origin = "pca",
                  Species = train$Species),
  embeded_points %>% 
    tibble::as_tibble() %>% 
    setNames(c("dim_1","dim_2")) %>% 
    dplyr::mutate(data_origin = "embeded_points",
                  Species = train$Species)
  )

Viz_data_encoded %>% 
  ggplot(aes(dim_1,dim_2, color = data_origin))+
  geom_point()

```

And now when we add back the labels to this embedding we see something VERY exciting... The deeplearning model has learned something by looking in the mirror the PCA doesn't quite get yet... It is as if the PCA needed one extra layer of abstraction to learn that a line transform could've split versicolor and virginica further away from one another...

```{r}
Viz_data_encoded %>% 
  ggplot(aes(dim_1,dim_2, color = Species))+
  geom_point()+
  facet_wrap(~data_origin)
```

We can tell that the PCA and encoders produce slightly different results... But we should remember that the purpose of the encoder and it's loss function was to embed the information into lower dimensions - so ultimately we should compare predictive properties...

#### Measure prediction accuracy

```{r}
benchmark <- 
Viz_data_encoded %>%
  mutate(Species = train$Species %>% rep(times = 2)) %>% 
  group_by(data_origin) %>% 
  nest() %>% 
  # mutate(model_lm = data %>% map(glm,formula = Species~., family = binomial())) %>% 
  # mutate(performance = model_lm %>% map(broom::augment)) %>% 
  # unnest(performance,.drop = FALSE)
  mutate(model_caret = data %>% map(~caret::train(form = Species~.,data = .x,method = "rf"))) 
  
benchmark

```

```{r}
for(i in seq_along(benchmark$model_caret)){
  print(benchmark$data_origin[[i]])
  print(benchmark$model_caret[[i]])
}
```

Absolutely crazy...

The embedding done by the encoder was clearly more useful for actual prediction, even though the encoded metrics seemed very lossy. My interpretation of this is that the encoder kept only those features it believed important to represent the original data linearly as apposed to the pca's loss function which tried to optimize the principle components for explaining variability...

In summary the autoencoder for the iris dataset believes after training that most of the variation in the imput dimensions are just 'noise' and that the lossy linear reconstruction is actually better at predicting Species than a standard PCA performed by the caret package?

### Conclusion

- Encoders do well if we are preparing high dimensional data for some regression model or deep learning model.  
- Encoders cannot replace dimensionality reduction techniques for visualizing high dimensional features unless a very well defined loss function is used together with a well tuned network  
- Encoders are very good at reconstructing data without "noise"
