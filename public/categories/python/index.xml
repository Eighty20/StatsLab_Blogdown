      <description>This blog will take a look at scraping the TomTom and Google Places APIs to get all the points of interest in an area. A recursive grid search algorithm is discussed that efficiently identifies all of the POIs in a large area where there is a limit on the number of results the API returns. 
TomTom vs Google First, let&amp;rsquo;s compare each API:
    TomTom Google Places     Max free daily requests 2500 2500   Max results returned 100 20   Point search Yes Yes   Max point search radius none 50km   Rectangle search Yes No   Up-to-date No Yes    In each case, you need to register for your own API key which you include as a parameter in the search.</description>

      <description>This is a follow on post to Stefan&amp;rsquo;s original to show how to generate a blog post from a Jupyter Notebook instead of an R markdown. This post itself started off life as a Jupyter Notebook which lives in the same content/posts folder as the other Rmd files used for the site. We&amp;rsquo;ll walk through how it became a blog post.
The process is a little more complicated than for the Rmd files (since that&amp;rsquo;s what Blogdown was built for but we can still get it to work relatively easily.</description>
