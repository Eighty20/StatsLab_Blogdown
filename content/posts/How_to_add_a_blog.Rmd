```

## Pre-requisites

- Install blogdown and Hugo in R-Console  
<https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/installation.html>  

## Create from scratch

Creating it from scratch is probably the easiest since you can run and test your code as you type it up. This way you don't have to worry about changing your relative file paths...  

### Clone or open the blog repository from github

#### Using R-studio

In R-studio open the terminal tab or press `shift-alt-t`.  

Navigate to the directory where you wish to save the repo using `cd` and `mkdir`.  

Inside this directory run the command:  
`git clone https://github.com/Eighty20/StatsLab_Blogdown.git`

#### Using GitBash in windows

Create a folder to work in.  

Open GitBash in this folder (try using `right-click`).  

Run the command:  
`git clone https://github.com/Eighty20/StatsLab_Blogdown.git`

### Create a post using "Addins" dropdown

Open the R project file inside the repository  

Click on the `Addins - New Post` button

- Name it  
- Change output folder to "posts"  
- Change category to R  
- Add some tags  
- Change ouput format to .Rmd

### Change/check your date format

The website expects your date to be formatted as a number not text and it wants yyyy-mm-dd

### Write a kickass post

#### How to add data

Save all your data inside of `website/static/data/`. Create a folder for your data so we don't polute this folder too quickly.  

Since you are inside `website/content/posts/` you need to reference your data accordingly:  
`data.table::fread("../../static/data/your-folder/your-dataset")`

#### How to add pictures

Place your pictures inside `website/static/Pictures/`  

insert your pictures using:  
`![](/Pictures/your-image.jpg)`  

### Compile your new work using Blogdown

Now that you have finished your epic post you need to knit the post. You don't need to click the Knit button; just run the following command in Console:  
`blogdown::serve_site()`  

You should see a preview of your work in the Viewer pane:

This is interactive and will update if you continue editing the page  

### Push your post to the website

Now that the site has been previewed and your post looks OK you can push the changes to the github repo that the site is monitoring:  

Go to your terminal and make sure you are in the root folder of the website.  

- Get the remote nodes  
`git fetch`  
- Check that you are up to date  
`git status`  
- If you are behind you should first pull  
`git pull`  
- Stage/add your work to the website  
`git add .`  
- Save your work  
`git commit -m "this is my save of this work where I did this post"`  
- Update the site  
`git push`  

The website will check in on the repository every now and then, wait 15 min and refresh the page  


## Create from existing Rmd

- Clone/fork or open the blog repository from github  
- Copy your Rmd into `/content/posts/`  
- Change your data and picture references  
- Compile your new work using Blogdown  
- Push your post to the website
