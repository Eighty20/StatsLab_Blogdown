"Manufacturing requirement","Theoretical ability of ML to meet requirements"
"Ability to handle high-dimensional problems and data-sets with reasonable effort","Certain ML techniques (e.g. SVM) are capable of handling high dimensionality (>1000) very well. However, accompanying issues like possible over-fitting has to be considered (Widodo & Yang, 2007; Yang & Trewn, 2004)"
"Ability to reduce possibly complex nature of results and present transparent and concrete advice for practitioners (e.g. monitor XX and parameter YY at checkpoint ZZ)","ML may be able to derive pattern from existing data and derive approximations about future behavior (Alpaydin, 2010). This new information (knowledge) may support process owners in their decision-making or used to automatically improve a system"
"Ability to adapt to changing environment with reasonable effort and cost. Ideally a degree auf ‘automated’ adaptation to changing condition","As ML is part of AI, and thus be able to learn and adapt to changes, ‘the system designer need not foresee and provide solutions for all possible situations’ (Alpaydin, 2010). Learning from and adapting to changing environments automatically is a major strength of ML (Lu, 1990; Simon, 1983)"
"Ability to further the existing knowledge by learning from results","ML can contribute to create new information and possibly knowledge by, e.g. identifying patters in existing data (Alpaydin, 2010; Pham & Afify, 2005)"
"Ability to work with the available manufacturing data without special requirements toward capturing of very specific information at the start","ML techniques are designed to derive knowledge out of existing data (Alpaydin, 2010; Kwak & Kim, 2012). ‘The stored data becomes useful only when it is analyzed and turned into information that we can make use of, for example, to make predictions’ (Alpaydin, 2010)"
"Ability to identify relevant process intra- and inter-relations & ideally correlation and/or causality","The goal of certain ML techniques is to detect certain patterns or regularities that describe relations (Alpaydin, 2010)"
