      <description>Why it matters When working with recurring clients and projects together with tight deadlines it is easy to cut corners or forget good practice.
Here are the top reasons why a data science workflow is vital:
 Work is well documented
 Folders and files logically are structured
 Projects remain version controlled
 Data output is tracked
 Logical seperation of scripts make productizing easy
 Good naming conventions make tracking of the project flow easy</description>

      <description>Introduction This document will cover in depth the use of DoE experiments in R! We will focus our attention to measuring treatment effects, not variances.
Based on the work:
Lawson, John. Design and Analysis of Experiments with R. Chapman and Hall/CRC, 20141217. VitalBook file.
  Definitions  Experiment (also called a Run) is an action where the experimenter changes at least one of the variables being studied and then observes the effect of his or her actions(s).</description>
