      <description>Writing code is hard enough. But it sucks when your desktop OS seems to be actively fighting against you actually getting anything done. The best case scenario is that you&amp;rsquo;re running a Unix/Linux based OS. If you&amp;rsquo;re running something fairly mainstream like Ubuntu, chances are most everything you need works out the box (apart from wireless and graphics card drivers of course) and most of the documentation, tutorials and resources on the internet assume that.</description>
